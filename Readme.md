# Note2Site 📚✨

**Note2Site** is a personal book summary automation platform that transforms your reading notes into a beautifully displayed, versioned online collection. It combines AI, GitHub, and modern web technologies to give your notes life on the web.

## How It Works

### 1️⃣ Submit Your Summary
Use the **Streamlit Upload App**: [Upload Your Summary] 
- Provide your book summary and optional metadata like author, rating, or tags.  

### 2️⃣ AI Enhances Your Notes
The system uses a **large language model (LLM)** to:  
- Generate a concise, engaging summary.  
- Suggest relevant **tags, themes, and moods**.  
- Produce a **catchy tagline**.  
- Recommend **related books**.  

### 3️⃣ Automatic Publishing
- AI output is compiled into a **Markdown file**.  
- Pushed directly to a **GitHub repository**.  
- GitHub version control ensures your notes are safe and organized.

### 4️⃣ Live Frontend Display
- The **React/Next.js frontend**: [View Notes](https://note2site.vercel.app/)  
- **Vercel rebuilds automatically** whenever a new summary is added.  
- Displays your summaries in a **clean, readable layout** with metadata and related book suggestions.
